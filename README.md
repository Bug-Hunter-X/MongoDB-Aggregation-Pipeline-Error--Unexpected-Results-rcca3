# MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline Error: Unexpected Results
This repository demonstrates a common error in MongoDB aggregation pipelines that leads to unexpected results. The issue is caused by an incorrect combination of grouping, sorting, and limiting stages, resulting in an inaccurate top-N result.

## Problem
The provided aggregation pipeline aims to find the top 10 documents based on a sum of values, but due to a logical flaw in the pipeline, it doesn't accurately reflect the expected top 10.

## Solution
The solution involves carefully reviewing the aggregation pipeline, ensuring that the grouping, sorting, and limiting stages are correctly ordered and applied to achieve the desired results. This often involves checking the logic of the grouping key and the sorting criteria.

## How to reproduce
1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure you have MongoDB and a Node.js environment set up.
3. Insert sample data into your MongoDB collection using the script provided.
4. Run the `bug.js` script to observe the incorrect output from the flawed aggregation pipeline.
5. Run the `bugSolution.js` script to see the corrected aggregation pipeline generating the expected output.
